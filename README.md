humann2
=======

Modified version of the humann2 pipeline. Modifications include:

* `--compress` option to compress output files during the pipeline run (sames disk space)
* Input reads can be gzipped (ending with `.gz`)

## Notes

* The `humann2/data/` directory is not included in the repo due to github file size limitations.
